Developed and implemented a brushless DC (BLDC) motor drive system using a TI F2837x DSP microcontroller. Designed six-step trapezoidal voltage control based on Hall effect sensor feedback to achieve precise rotor position detection and commutation. Configured PWM modules for three-phase inverter control, integrated interrupt-based speed measurement using hardware timers, and implemented direction reversal logic through adaptive sector switching. Validated system performance via oscilloscope measurements and tachometer-based speed verification, achieving reliable closed-loop motor control.
